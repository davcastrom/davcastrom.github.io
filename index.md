## About me

I'm a Master in Ecology and an bioinformatics/tech enthusiast originally from Chile. Currently, I'm finishing my PhD in Biology at the Swedish University of Agricultura Sciences in Ume√•, Sweden.

I'm interested in how plants sense and responds to environmetal stressors and the modulation of plant-microbiome interactions.
